## ðŸ“– About This Project

This project focuses on building a clean, professional digital RÃ©sumÃ© that showcases your skills, experience, and achievements in a modern web interface. More importantly, it serves as a practical learning tool for mastering Laravel's core concepts through real-world implementation. The RÃ©sumÃ© content is dynamically sourced from local JSON files and processed using Laravel's powerful service container and file system abstractions.

This project is available through [CodeArch](https://codearch.app) - a curated collection of development projects broken down into manageable, step-by-step tasks. The Single Page Digital RÃ©sumÃ© project guides you through building a complete Laravel application while learning core framework concepts.
